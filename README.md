LLMO is the AI pair programming tool that meets you where you are (your terminal) ðŸ˜‰

With the **"staging area"**, you can keep files in the context window without the hassle of copying and pasting every time you make changes to your code.


## Features

- Interactive Chat: Enjoy real-time, interactive programming assistance in your terminal.
- Staging Area: Easily add files to the AI's context to update it about your ongoing coding tasks. No need to copy and paste updates.
- Model Customization: Choose the OpenAI model that fits your needs.
- Personality: By default, Elmo loves to make bodybuilding references. This can be turned off through a CLI flag or environment variable.

## Notes

### Authentication

This application uses the [OpenAI][openai] API.

You will need to authenticate with your own API Key.

### Copying Text

[Textual][textual] runs the terminal in application mode. The means that you can't simply copy content as you normally would.
In [iterm2][iterm2], you can hold down the `option` key to select text. See the documentation for your terminal emulator for more information.
